                <p class="article-text">If you ever watched MacGyver, remember how he always found ways to solve problems with whatever was lying around when he was in a jam?  I always thought that was so cool!  Next time before you run out to the store to buy something, give yourself a chance to be resourceful and see if you already have something at your house that you can use instead.  You’ll save money while being eco-friendly reusing what you already have.

                    <br><br>For those of you who’ve ever read the magazine Real Simple, I’m sure you love the pages they have on new ways to use everyday things as much as I do!  One of the best tips I now use several times a week is using rubber bands to open jars and bottles that are new or screwed on too tight.  Who would have thought that something I had lying around in my desk drawer would get so much use in the kitchen.  Plus I saved myself about $45 not having to buy an electric lid opener!</p>

                <h2>June 12, 2021</h2>

                <p style="text-align: center" class="article-text">Never give up. Today is hard, and tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be the sunshine.   </p>
                <p style="text-align: center" class="article-text"><strong>-Jack Ma</strong>  </p>
                <p class="article-text">Whenever you feel like giving up on your goals, just ask yourself a question: Is giving up a solution for my problems? If not, then keep working. Just think of all the people who would be happy to see you successful. Spend some time with yourself. Think about the life that you desire, the life which you will live when you achieve your goal.

                    <br><br>Imagine yourself already standing at a College or a University or a T.V show where you are being appreciated and awarded for your success. Never bother about the people who hate you. Haters only hate you because they think that you can achieve something that they can’t.</p>
